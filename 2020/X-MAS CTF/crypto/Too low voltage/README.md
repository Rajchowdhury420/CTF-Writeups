## The Vulnerability ( Low Voltage Attack on RSA!!! (a.k.a Bellcore attack) )
RSA-CRT transforms message m into signature s using private key **p, q, dp, dq** as follows:

<p align="center">
    sp = ( mp )<sup>dp</sup> mod p, <br>
    sq = ( mq )<sup>dq</sup> mod q, <br>
    s = ( ( (sq – sp) · pinv)mod q)· p + sp,
</p>

where **mp = m mod p, mq = m mod q, pinv = p<sup>–1</sup>mod q**. Suppose either  **sp**  or  **sq**  is computed with a fault. Assume that the resulting faulty 
signature  **s'**  together with the correct signature **s** are known to the attacker. Then he can retrieve the private key by computing 

<p align="center">
    gcd(s – s', N)
