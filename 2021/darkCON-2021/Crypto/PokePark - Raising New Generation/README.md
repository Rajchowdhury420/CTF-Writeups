The name of the challenge was supposed to be a hint that it's Park-Miller Random Number Generator ðŸ˜…. Here is a little bit of intro stuff about 
this Random Number Generator (RNG).

<p align="center"><b>
State[i+1] = m * State[i] mod n
</b></p>

where **m** is the multiplier and n is the prime modulus. So the next **State[i+1]** is determined by multiplying the
current **State[i]** with **m** and then mod **n**.

## Predicting The Next State
### The Modulus
According to this - [Cracking a linear congruential generator](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4268/cracking-a-linear-congruential-generator)
we can recover the modulus by this method:

*To recover m, define t<sub>n</sub> = s<sub>n</sub> + 1 - s<sub>n</sub> and u<sub>n</sub> = |t<sub>n</sub> + 2 * t<sub>n</sub> - t2<sub>n</sub> + 1|;
then with high probability you will have m = gcd(u1, u2, ..., u10). 10 here is arbitrary; if you make it k, then the probability that this fails is 
exponentially small in k.*

### The Multiplier
We can get the multiplier by solving the two linear equations only,
<p align="center"><b>
s1 = s0 * m + c  (mod n) <br>
s2 = s1 * m + c  (mod n) <br>
s2 - s1 = s1 * m - s0 * m  (mod n) <br>
s2 - s1 = m * (s1 - s0)  (mod n) <br>
m = ((s2 - s1) * inverse_mod(s1 - s0, n)) (mod n)
</b></p>

where **s0, s1 and s2** are the three consecutive states.

### The Increment
The increment for Lehmer RNG is 0 but if you want you can recover that too,
<p align="center"><b>
s1 = s0 * m + c   (mod n) <br>
c  = s1 - s0 * m  (mod n)
</b></p>

Now that we have the modulus, multiplier and the increment( which is 0 anyway) we can predict the next state like this:

<p align="center"><b>
next_state = m * last_state + c (mod n)
</b></p>

Now submit the predicted value and get the flag !!! \o/
